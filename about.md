I am a freshman at MIT, probably majoring in 6-2 (EECS).
I plan on taking 6.004 (Computer Architecture) and 6.046 (Algorithms) in the spring.

I enjoy hiking, reading (especially science fiction and fantasy), and building things in my free time.
Past projects include a [quadcopter][quad] built completely from scratch and multiple high voltage devices.

## Resume

[pdf copy of resume][resume]

I won second place in the Regeneron Science Talent Search for research on solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
My research involved developing a new method for solving PDEs that can achieve higher precision than current methods with less computational power.  You can [read more here][pde].  I plan on submitting a paper by the end of January.

I can code well in C++, Python, Julia, and MATLAB, and I use LaTeX to typset documents.
I plan on gaining proficiency in Rust.
In addition, I use Linux (Arch) on a daily basis.
From my research, I have experience reading and understanding technical papers.
