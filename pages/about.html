    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="textcontainer narrow">
      <p>
        I am currently a sophomore at MIT (class of 2021), majoring in electrical engineering and computer science.
        Although feedback systems are my primary interest, I like working on most sufficiently mathematical problems.
        When I have free time, I work on projects ranging in scope from room improvements to an Arduino-based quadcopter.
        I have tentative plans to start working on a dual resonant solid state Tesla coil once I finish my motorized shopping cart.
      </p>
      <h2>Relevant Coursework</h2>
      <p>
        I have taken 18.701 (algebra), 6.02 (digital communication), 6.003 (signal processing), and 6.046 (algorithms).
        Next semester, I plan on taking 6.011 (advanced signal processing), 6.013 (electromagnetic fields), 6.302 (feedback systems), and 6.101 (analog circuits).
      </p>
      <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I have a good working knowledge of controls and dynamics from various personal projects.
        I am also familiar with mathematical reasoning and problem solving, as well as with the scientific research and publishing process.
        I am a competent Python and C++ programmer, and I am also familiar with MATLAB, Julia and LaTeX.
