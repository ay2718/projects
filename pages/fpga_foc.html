    <h1>Brushless Motor Controller</h1>
    <div class="textcontainer">
      <p> In the fall 2019 semester, I took 6.111 (digital logic design).
      Jackson Gray and I built a brushless motor controller as a final project for the class.
      The switching logic for the controller was running on a Digilent Cmod A7 FPGA module, and for maximum power, we used a 2004 Prius inverter.
      The Prius inverter has the advantage that it is designed to several hundred volts of input power, a few hundred amps of output current, and costs about $100 from a scrapyard.
      It's an impressively powerful inverter for impressively cheap, and it's nearly impossible to accidentally blow up, making it a great piece of test hardware for large motors.
      </p>

      <p>
      Based on some older work by Bayley Wang on reverse engineering the prius inverter <a href="https://isopack.blogspot.com/2016/05/bremsproject-season-2-part-1-new.html">here</a>, Jackson and I were able to control the inverter and get current sensor feedback.
      </p>

      A copy of our final report is <a target="_blank" href="/projects/assets/fpga_foc/fpga_foc.pdf">here</a>.

      <p>
      We used a Hyundai Sonata hybrid alternator motor as a test motor.
      This motor is an IPM capable of outputting roughly 20 kW, so it's a good motor for testing a brushless motor controller.
      It has a relatively high winding inductance, so it works reasonably well with a low switching frequency.
      A paper for 6.640 where I analyze the motor's electrical properties is <a target="_blank" href="/projects/assets/fpga_foc/final_project.pdf">here</a>.
