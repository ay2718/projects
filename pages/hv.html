        I found a large CRT TV and grabbed the flyback transformer.
        The transformer is driven by a ZVS driver modified to run off of rectified mains power.
        The output of the transformer is about 40 kV, and the driver draws about 1.5 kW.<br>

        I've always liked building high voltage devices.
        In eighth grade, I built a Wimshurst machine&mdash;a high voltage static electric generator.
        Although measuring the exact voltage was not possible, I was able to produce sparks about 30cm long, giving an estimated voltage in the tens of kilovolts.

        In high school, my friends and I built a low power flyback transformer driver.
        We did some high voltage wood burning, and after cleaning and staining the wood, we got a surprising artistic result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new flyback driver used a larger number of turns on the primary coil, smaller tank capacitors, and high voltage rated IGBTs.
        Unfortunately, the IGBTs died due to gate failure, and I ran out of IGBTs.
