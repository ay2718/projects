<em>A vortex street develops and stabilizes behind a stationary object in a moving incompressible fluid.
Red regions represent positive vorticity (counterclockwise rotation) and blue regions represent negative vorticity (clockwise rotation).  These images were generated with the PDE solver code I wrote for my research. </em>

Partial differential equations (PDEs for short) are a fascinating class of equations.
PDEs accurately represent most physical phenomena that we see in everyday life, from heat transfer to electromagnetism to fluid dynamics.
Solving PDEs by hand is usually impossible or impractical, so numerical methods must be used to understand them.
Most PDE solvers operate by approximating the domain with polygon or polyhedron mesh.
For instance, a typical PDE solver solving for structural stresses on a bridge would decompose the volume of the bridge into small tetrahedrons.
The polygons or polyhedra create a set of basis functions on the domain that are solvable with a matrix equation.
